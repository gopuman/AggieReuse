This module focuses on keeping track of students/customers and monitoring the store's foot traffic. An overhead camera records the video of people entering and exiting the store. Leveraging Machine Learning and Image Processing Techniques, the module accurately detects people and determines their direction of movement (entry or exit) - counting the number of people entering the store and the number of people exiting the store.
